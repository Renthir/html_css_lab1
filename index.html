        <h2>What is Nederland?</h2>
        <p>The Netherlands is a country in Europe, often mistakenly refered to as Holland. 
            This is understandable, as Holland is one of the Netherlands most popular regions. 
            Nederland is the name of the Netherlands in the native tongue, Dutch! 
            There is also a lot of confusion about Dutch and Deutschland, as they sound similar,
            but be assured these are different and we needn't dwell on this now.

        <h2>
            Ok, so what is the Netherlands like?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Netherlands is a coastal country who have, over the past several hundred years, 
            pushed the sea back many miles, giving them more and more land to build cities and 
            agriculture on. This has led many of their cities to be built with a system of canals
            that add a great charm to the already beautiful cities. They are also well known for 
            their many large windmills that still dot the landscape today, as well as for their many
            fields of beautiful tulips that still play a big part in their economy, today!
        </p>
        <p>
            Many parts of the Netherlands pride themselves on making sure that any way you want to travel
            is still reasonably conventient and timely. The roads try to cater to pedestrians and bikes first,
            but there are also many public transit options as well as plenty of roadspace. This travel accomodation
            has left nearly everyone pleased, as anyone can get where they need the way they want to, instead of being 
            restricted to one or two options.
